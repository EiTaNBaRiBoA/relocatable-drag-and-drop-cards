# Swappable Drag And Drop Cards

My expirmental asset to add mechanics for transferring cards within a single field (be it a battlefield or a player's hand)

## Background
While playing Hearthstone Battlegrounds, I noticed that the character affects the leftmost card in the hand, but it is impossible to change the location of cards in the hand, although it can be done on the field.

I decided to implement the mechanics of moving cards in the hand, because in other card games like Magic: The Gathering or Heartstone and in Godot Asset Store there is no such function. 

As a result, it turned out to create not so much a "special hand" as a universal field with swappable card mechanics.

## How It Works
